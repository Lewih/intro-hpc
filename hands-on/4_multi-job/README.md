Round the table questions:
which scenario applies most to your use case?
   - will you be running large parallel jobs — make sure your jobs use all the resources
   - or some medium-sized jobs
   - or lots of small jobs — try bundling the jobs whenever possible

how will you be organizing your jobs?
   - will (most of) your jobs use a similar job script — try using variables and arguments
   - will your jobs depend on each other
   - or are they independent

Run the appropriate scenarios from the previous chapters
